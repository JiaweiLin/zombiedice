zombiedice
==========

A simulator for the dice game Zombie Dice that can run bot AI players.

To run the simulator, call zombiedice.runTournament(bots, 1000) where bots is a list of "Zombie Dice bot objects". This will run the text version of the simulator. The fancier web version in zombiedice_web.py looks better. Modify the BOTS list at the top of the file to have "Zombie Dice Bot objects" and then run the program. It will run a small web server and launch your browser.
