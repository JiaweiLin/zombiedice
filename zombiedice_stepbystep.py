Zombie Dice simulator by Al Sweigart (al@inventwithpython.com)
(I'm not affiliated with SJ Games. This is a hobby project.)

Note: A "turn" is a single player's turn. A "round" is every player having one turn.
Note: Since all variables are public in Python, it is trivial to have a bot that hacks the tournament code. Inspect the bot code before running it.
Note: We don't use OOP for bots. A "zombie dice bot" simply implements a turn() method which calls a global roll() function as often as it likes. See documentation for details.
